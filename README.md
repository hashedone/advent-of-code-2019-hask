This year I decided to contribute in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
trying myself in two languages: Rust which is for now my main language, 
and Haskell, which I try to learn this way (find my Rust solutions
[here](https://github.com/hashedone/advent-of-code-2019-rust)).

For Haskell I am just trying to have working, as idiomatic as possible
solutions, but I am not an expert on this field. I assume not pushing
Haskell solutions, and giving up when it would be to difficult (or at
least figure out solutions later) - I have a job and a live, so I
assume not having couple hours a day to solve tricky problems with
language I don't know.
